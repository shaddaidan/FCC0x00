                times. They should be there to listen to you, offer advice, and help you through whatever

             adventorous and to explore</li>
            
             <li><span>Yaki</span> - my second oldest friend(we have plans of making our children 
                marry each other) here imagination ran wild and the value of innocence and just
            enjoying a good friendship was there</li>
            
            <li><span>Samuel</span> - my coolest friend to date i would say that made me do cool things and at
             the same time wasnt trying to change me, very huge impact on my life.</li>
            
             <li><span>Reginald</span> - i would say he is my closest friend and we laugh a lot like a lottt
            you could say that we spend more time laughing than talking when we are together</li>
            
            <li><span>Jedidiah</span> - he is a cool guy in his own way, very caring and very very driven he
             is one of those friends that you watched become something great infront of your eyes and it inspires you</li>
            
            <li><span>Mohammed</span> - oh my goodness he is just wonderful, Mohammed is like the best i dont think
             there is anything that you would tell him that he wouldnt give his time to listen to you and understand you
             he is just absolutely wonderful</li>
            
             <li><span>Seyi</span> - ohhh yeah this is my emotional friend and no thats not an insult he is a very good 
            listener and he doesnt just listen to words to hear what you are saying but he genuinely sees the person
        and empathizes with you, and great cook and he is patient with you in his own way yeah</li>
            
            <li><span>Olofu</span> - now this guy is like the OG friend and w ehave the same interests 
            and everything and he is so patient with me and understanding and is always understanding
         you know all those friends that you know you dont deserve because they stick around with you
         regardless of how much your character changes this is Olofu</li>

            <li><span>Lumpkin</span> - so again probably the nicest person i know or ive met ever, like i dont
             know if ive ever needed him and he didnt help me out, i cant think of a single instance and he is 
            very brilliant one of the naturally smartest person i know that ive met yeah just astounding sometimes 
            how his humanity always bursts through with every interaction you have with him.</li>

            <li><span>Taiwo</span> - he is also a cool guy, he can be misunderstood and he also might not fully 
            get himself i think but regardless you just know he is a sweet guy and one of those people you can 
            ask anything and you can tell anything oh sorry when i think he is smarter than lumpkin if you ask me 
            i think i would say Taiwo is naturally smartest person i know yeah</li>

            <li><span>Ebun</span> - she is something, you have to meet her first, just wonderful and its also 
            funny cause when you meet her she seems to be all logic and no emotions and to always get it, 
            but when you get to know her youll realise she is pretty emotional and sweet and kind and caring 
            oh yeah and smart really smart, yeah i hangout with a lot of smart people i was hoping it would rub 
            off on me but oh well, i guess it didnt work.</li>
            <li><span>Watti</span> - he is really tall and he would like you to know that yeah, and pretty interesting 
            he is also weird, nut lumpkin is the a lot more weird than him, watti is wonderful</li>
            <li><span>Saleeman</span> - actually one of the coolet persons i know, he is funny as hell with his memes 
            he isnt really good with the ladies sha, but one day i would teach him my ways(smirks afterwards) 
            he is basically very relaxed about everthing in general.</li>
            <li><span>Ibukun</span> - oh yeah uhm, she kind of represents this form of consistency in my life 
            in a sense, nothing weird like, everthing changes and the people i talk to change over time but 
            we still have our regular weird conversations which can take weeks to reply but we always reply and 
            that is always nice to know that hasnt change and somewhere i believe that wouldnt change.</li>
            <li><span>Jossy</span> - well jossy is the litersl best thats all i can say, like i would end it here
            when you meet her you would understand she is fantastic.</li>
            </ul>

                    What I realize now in hindsight is that there is a natural ebb and flow to friendships.
                     There are times you think there's nothing left between you, that you've hit the bottom,
                      but the special ones survive, find ways of restoring themselves.
